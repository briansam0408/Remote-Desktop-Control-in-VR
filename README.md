# Remote Desktop Control in VR 🎮  
*A Unity-based Virtual Reality research project on immersive desktop interaction*

---

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how **Virtual Reality (VR)** can transform remote desktop control into a 3D immersive experience.  
Using **Unity** and **VR SDKs**, users can view, access, and interact with their computer desktops in a virtual workspace — opening applications, managing files, and multitasking using VR controllers and gestures.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary
Traditional remote desktop tools (like AnyDesk or TeamViewer) are limited to 2D screens.  
This project enhances the experience by:
- Streaming a real-time desktop view into a VR space  
- Allowing users to interact naturally using **controllers**, **head tracking**, and **gestures**  
- Providing a **secure**, **low-latency**, and **immersive** workspace for productivity and remote collaboration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| Category | Tools / Frameworks |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Game Engine** | Unity 3D (LTS Version) |
| **Languages** | C# (Unity Scripting), Python/C++ (optional networking) |
| **Networking** | WebRTC / Socket Programming |
| **VR SDKs** | Oculus SDK / OpenXR / SteamVR |
| **IDE & Tools** | Visual Studio, Blender, OBS, FFmpeg |
| **Version Control** | GitHub |

## 🧩 System Architecture
**Client-Server Model**
- **Host Desktop (Server):** Captures and streams desktop view in real-time  
- **VR Client (Unity):** Renders the streamed view in 3D space and handles user interactions  
- **Networking Layer:** Ensures secure and low-latency streaming (WebRTC)  
- **Input Handling:** Maps VR gestures and controller actions to desktop commands
